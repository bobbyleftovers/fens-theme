# Fen's Theme

### Setup
Clone or download this repo, then open a terminal and navigate to the themes root. Run `npm install` and `composer install` to install dependencies. After that finishes, start the build process using `npm start`. This command will stay running and recompile your assets on file save.

### Notes
This theme is a lot like sage 8 with the exception that it's js assets have been updated to use es6 tools. I've also added Carbon Fields as a composer dependency for the theme. Vue.js is built in as well bbut it isn't required to use it.
