# Fen's Theme
## PHP 7+, Vue.js, Material components, Carbon Fields, and Webpack

### Wonderful, another one
I find that a good number of wp themes have a lot of bloat, are not clear on where assets and resources belong, and, most importanly, don't encourage developers to write good code that separates concerns well and looks forward from versions of PHP past 5.4. That's what I'm trying to address with this. I'm especially interested in writing code that will work in PHP 7+ without actually requiring the author to upgrade the servers version of PHP since that's not always possible.n I built this with sage 9 in mind so much of the architechture is similar to that. Babel is included to keep the code ES6-compliant. Hope you enjoy. Fen, by the way, is my cat.

### Setup:
Clone or download this repo, then open a terminal and navigate to the themes root. Run `npm install` to install dependencies. After that finishes, start the build process using `npm start`
